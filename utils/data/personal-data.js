I am a dedicated Fullstack Developer with 4 years of hands-on experience, including 3 years in frontend development and 1 year in fullstack projects. Over this time, I have worked on multiple real-world applications, gaining expertise in modern frameworks, scalable architectures, and clean coding practices.
